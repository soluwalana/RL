"""Egress policies for untrusted sandboxes.

Callers supply allow targets only; deny CIDRs for non-public space are computed here with those
addresses subtracted. Explicit denies are required because OpenSandbox ``dns+nft`` learns A/AAAA
from allowed domains into ``@dyn_allow`` *after* ``@deny``, so a wildcard like ``*.com`` can
otherwise rebind to a private IP that was only blocked by omission.
