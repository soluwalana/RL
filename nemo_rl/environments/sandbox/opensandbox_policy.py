"""OpenSandbox wire format for the shared egress policy.

Both sandbox tiers create OpenSandbox sandboxes and must render the same :class:`EgressPolicy`
into the same create block. Neither owns that rendering, so it lives beside the policy type
instead of inside one tier with the other importing across the seam.
