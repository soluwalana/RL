"""HTTP surface of the trusted episode provisioning broker.

The job sandbox reaches the broker over HTTP and never as a Ray client: joining the training Ray
cluster is exactly what the surrounding design forbids, since a GCS address is cluster-wide
scheduling authority.

This module imports no Ray and no training code, so it can be exercised without a cluster. Ray
placement and process lifecycle live in :mod:`nemo_rl.environments.sandbox.broker_actor`.
