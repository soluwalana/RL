"""Rebuild untrusted broker requests into specs the broker is willing to forward.

This is the broker's trust boundary. Its governing rule is **allowlist reconstruction**: build a
fresh spec out of known-safe fields rather than deleting dangerous ones from the caller's request.
You cannot forward what you never read, so a backend that later grows a new passthrough field
cannot reopen a path that was closed here.

The concrete levers this closes, in the OpenSandbox reference backend, are volumes (host bind
mounts, a neighbour's PVC), ``platform``, snapshot references that would sidestep the image
policy, and ``extensions`` -- notably ``bootstrap.execd.isolation``, which grants ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN``
with unconfined seccomp and AppArmor. None of them are fields on a sanitized spec.

The broader reason the broker exists is that isolation must not depend on backend configuration we
do not control. OpenSandbox does reject host bind mounts server-side by default, but "by default"
is a setting; the guarantee here does not rely on it.
