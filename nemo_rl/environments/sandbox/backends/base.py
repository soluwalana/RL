"""Backend seam for episode sandboxes.

The broker is the only OpenSandbox client for episodes, but it is not bound to OpenSandbox: it
talks to whatever satisfies :class:`EpisodeSandboxBackend`. Backends receive a
:class:`SanitizedEpisodeSpec` -- never a caller's request -- so a backend that grows a new
passthrough field cannot reopen an escalation path the broker closed.
