"""In-memory episode backend for development and tests.

Provisions nothing and isolates nothing. It exists so the broker, the NeMo-Gym client, and the
``SandboxedGymActor`` handshake can be exercised without a cluster. Selecting it requires two
independent config keys so it cannot be reached by a single typo.
