"""OpenSandbox episode backend.

Delegates to NeMo-Gym's ``OpenSandboxProvider`` rather than reimplementing it: the retry
classification, readiness probing, reconnect-after-create polling, and non-root exec handling
there are load-bearing and stay single-sourced. What this module owns is the part that has to be
trusted -- building the create request field by field from an already-sanitized spec, so nothing a
caller supplied can ride along, and establishing the egress policy at the only moment OpenSandbox
allows it.
